# mudclient38-recreated
One step backwards from mudclient39, based on the known differences &amp; documentations. This client aims to recreate the version of the client from 2001-May-08.

## FAQ
**Q:** How is this different from mudclient39?<br/>
**A:** Per [this newspost](https://classic.runescape.wiki/w/Update:Lots_of_small_improvements_(10_May_2001)) from 2001-May-10, mudclient39 "Reorganised the stats list to prepare for coming updates" and "Introduced new quest-point system to replace the old 'influence' system". Based on old screenshots and fansites such as the ones below, the old stats list and GoodMagic / EvilMagic skill were re-implemented in mudclient39.

**Q:** config17.jag?<br/>
**A:** Yes. Like the recreated mudclient38 that is released here, config17.jag is also a recreation of what must have been needed for the 2001-May-08 client. GoodMagic and EvilMagic spells are stored in config17.jag.

**A:** We do not own mudclient39.
